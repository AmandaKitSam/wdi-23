The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

const numChildren = 15;
const partnerName = 'Cedric';
const geoLocation = 'Tangier';
const jobTitle = 'window washer';

const fortune = "You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geoLocation + ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids.";

console.log(fortune);
